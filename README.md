# 911-Calls-Analysis
The 911 Calls Analysis Capstone Project focuses on analyzing emergency call data to gain insights into the patterns, trends, and characteristics of 911 calls. This project aims to enhance data analysis and visualization skills while exploring real-world emergency response data.
## Project Description
The project involves the analysis of 911 call data obtained from Kaggle.com. The dataset consists of emergency call information from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The dataset contains various fields, including latitude, longitude, description of the emergency call, ZIP code, title, timestamp, township, address, and a dummy variable.
The main objectives of this project are to:

Import and preprocess the 911 call dataset.

Explore the data through various questions and inquiries.

Create new features from the existing data for deeper analysis.

Visualize the data using bar plots, line plots, and heatmaps.

Identify patterns, trends, and insights from the data.

Gain practical experience in data analysis and visualization techniques.
## Key Features
Dataset Source: The 911 call dataset is obtained from Kaggle.com, a platform for sharing datasets and participating in machine learning competitions.

Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics and distribution of the 911 call data.

Feature Engineering: Create new features from the available data to extract additional insights and support analysis.

Data Visualization: Generate visualizations, including bar plots, line plots, and heatmaps, to effectively communicate patterns and trends in the 911 call data.

Insight Generation: Derive meaningful insights from the analyzed data, such as the most common types of emergencies, busiest days or hours, and spatial distribution of emergency calls.
Skill Enhancement: Improve data analysis and visualization skills through hands-on experience with real-world emergency response data.
